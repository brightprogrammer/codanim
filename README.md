# Code Animations

This is where I keep my code for all simulations and animations. Things like working of an algorithm,
simulating real life phenomena etc... Hope you enjoy this. You can find the order in which I created
these simulations below and a working video or explanation video if it.

Most of the things here are my attempt to visualize how things happen behind the scenes. Also I kinda
like simulations! They are just AAAAAMAZINGGG!
